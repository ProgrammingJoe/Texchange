      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello Texchange visitor,</p>
      <p>My name is Joe and I am a 3rd year software engineering student studying at the University of Victoria.
      Thank you for visiting my web application.
      I developed Texchange in an effort to make textbook exchange at UVic easier than any other methods that are currently available.
      Texchange falls into the strictly niche market of UVic as only textbooks needed for the term can be listed. This was done
      make the application easier to follow and understand as it is not filled with all varietys of textbooks.
