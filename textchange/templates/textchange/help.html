      <p id="QA" class="header2">Potential Questions</p>
        <p class="basic-text">Below are some questions that we think you might have.</p>
        <p class="semibold header3">Are more schools going to be added to the application?</p>
        <p class="basic-text">Once we figure out an efficient way of getting other universities textbooks they will be added to the application.
        We are currently looking at SFU and UBC.</p>
        <p class="semibold header3">Why does the application take so long to initially load?</p>
        <p class="basic-text">Previouslly we were paying monthly bills for this service to be hosted however as it is not making us money we have opted for downgrading our hosting services.
        One of the downfalls of this is that if no one has used the application recently it will take awhile to load.</p>
        <p class="semibold header3">Why can't I message people on Facebook?</p>
        <p class="basic-text">If you do not have the option to message someone on Facebook then their security settings may be too strict.
        Make sure to set your settings so that "Anyone" can message you that people are not running into the same problem when messaging you.</p>
